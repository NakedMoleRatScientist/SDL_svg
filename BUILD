To build go into the SDL_svg/libsvg directory and do
make all
then
make install

Then go into the top directory SDL_svg and do
make all
then
make install

The test program SDL_svg/obj/svgtest can be used to pop up a window and
show an svg program.

Makefiles might need to be tweaked. Project depends on these other projects:

libxml2
libpng
libjpeg
zlib
SDL
